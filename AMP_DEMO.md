## üéØ Demo Structure

### **Phase 1**: Starting Point (Naive Implementation)
### **Phase 2**: Amp Analysis & Planning  
### **Phase 3**: Oracle-Guided Optimization
### **Phase 4**: Performance Validation
### **Phase 5**: GPU Acceleration

**Total Time**: 25-30 minutes  
**Key Outcome**: 33x speedup with exact numerical fidelity

## üìÇ **Phase 1: Starting Point (5 minutes)**

### **Set the Scene**
*"We have a working but naive Fortran‚ÜíKokkos translation of a real MITgcm algorithm. It's correct but slow."*

### **Show Initial State**
```bash
# Clone the starting repository
git clone https://github.com/sjarmak/gamma-technologies-demo.git
cd gamma-technologies-demo

# Test the NAIVE implementation (before Amp optimization)
./tools/build_kokkos.sh --kernel mitgcm_demo --backend openmp
kokkos/mitgcm_demo/build/kernel 1024 10 both
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Naive Time per iteration: 0.0046 seconds
No optimization - this is our baseline
```

### **Key Talking Points**:
- ‚úÖ Numerical correctness verified (`max_abs_diff = 0.0`)
- ‚ùå Performance: Multiple kernel launches causing overhead
- ‚ùå Memory: Suboptimal layout for GPU coalescing  
- ‚ùå Missing: Advanced Kokkos optimization patterns

*"This is where most manual translations stop. But Amp can take it much further."*

---

## üß† **Phase 2: Amp Analysis & Planning (5 minutes)**

### **Amp Prompt 1: Initial Analysis**
```
Analyze the MITgcm tridiagonal solver implementation in kokkos/mitgcm_demo/src/kernel.cpp. 
Identify performance bottlenecks and recommend specific Kokkos optimizations for GPU acceleration.
Focus on kernel launch overhead, memory access patterns, and team parallelism opportunities.
```

### **Expected Amp Response**:
Amp will identify:
1. **O(nk) kernel launch overhead** (~50 separate kernel calls)
2. **Memory layout issues** for GPU coalescing
3. **Missing team parallelism** opportunities
4. **Global memory usage** for temporaries

### **Amp Prompt 2: Get Oracle Guidance** 
```
Consult the Oracle to create a concrete optimization plan for this tridiagonal solver. 
I want specific code changes that will dramatically improve GPU performance while maintaining exact numerical accuracy.
```

### **Expected Oracle Analysis**:
Oracle provides **4 specific optimizations**:
- Single TeamPolicy kernel approach
- LayoutLeft for coalesced memory access
- RandomAccess traits for GPU caching  
- Team scratch memory for temporaries

### **Key Demo Moment**:
*"Notice how Amp doesn't just say 'make it faster' - it provides concrete, implementable optimizations with expected performance impact."*

---

## ‚ö° **Phase 3: Oracle-Guided Optimization (10 minutes)**

### **Amp Prompt 3: Implement Optimization**
```
Based on the Oracle recommendations, create an optimized version of the tridiagonal solver. 
Implement:
1. Single TeamPolicy kernel to eliminate launch overhead
2. LayoutLeft memory layout for GPU coalescing
3. RandomAccess memory traits for read-only data
4. Team scratch memory for temporaries

Create the optimized implementation in kokkos/mitgcm_demo_optimized/ and ensure it maintains perfect numerical accuracy.
```

### **Watch Amp Work**:
Amp will:
1. Create the optimized directory structure
2. Implement the TeamPolicy single-kernel approach
3. Add proper memory layout specifications
4. Configure team scratch memory allocation
5. Add performance comparison functionality

### **Verification Command**:
```bash
# Build the Amp-optimized version
./tools/build_kokkos.sh --kernel mitgcm_demo_optimized --backend openmp

# Test the optimization
kokkos/mitgcm_demo_optimized/build/kernel 1024 10 both
```

### **Expected Results**:
```
Naive Time per iteration: 0.0046 seconds
Optimized Time per iteration: 0.0001 seconds  
Speedup: 33.17x ‚ö°
```

### **Key Demo Moment**:
*"33x speedup achieved through AI-guided optimization while maintaining perfect numerical accuracy!"*

## üî¨ **Phase 4: Performance Validation (5 minutes)**

### **Amp Prompt 4: Create Validation Suite**
```
Create a comprehensive test suite that validates both numerical accuracy and performance improvements. 
I want to prove the optimizations maintain exact numerical fidelity while dramatically improving performance.
```

### **Watch Amp Create**:
1. Automated test script (`test_demo.sh`)
2. Numerical comparison tools
3. Performance benchmarking suite
4. Documentation for results

### **Run Validation**:
```bash
# Run Amp-created validation suite
./test_demo.sh
```

### **Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ Build successful
‚úÖ 33.17x speedup achieved  
‚úÖ Perfect numerical agreement verified
‚úÖ Demo package ready
```

### **Key Talking Points**:
- **Numerical fidelity**: `max_abs_diff = 0.0` maintained
