# ü§ñ Amp Demo: Step-by-Step Prompts & Expected Responses

## üéØ Interactive Amp Session Guide

This document provides the **exact prompts** and **expected responses** for demonstrating Amp's end-to-end HPC optimization capabilities.

---

## üìÇ **Setup: Starting Repository State**

**Presenter Action**: Clone and show starting point
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjarmak/gamma-technologies-demo.git
cd gamma-technologies-demo
```

**Key Message**: *"Here's our starting point - a working but naive Fortran‚ÜíKokkos translation."*

---

## üîç **Amp Prompt #1: Initial Code Analysis**

### **Prompt to Amp**:
```
I have a naive Fortran‚ÜíKokkos translation of a MITgcm tridiagonal solver that works but has poor performance. 

Please analyze kokkos/mitgcm_demo/src/kernel.cpp and identify the key performance bottlenecks. Focus on:
1. Kernel launch patterns  
2. Memory access efficiency
3. Parallelization opportunities
4. GPU optimization potential

Give me specific, actionable optimization recommendations.
```

### **Expected Amp Response**:
Amp should identify:

1. **Major Issue: O(nk) Kernel Launch Overhead**
   - ~50 separate `parallel_for` calls in nested loops
   - Each launch has GPU kernel setup/teardown cost
   - Dominates performance on GPU architectures

2. **Memory Layout Inefficiency** 
   - Default Kokkos layout may not be optimal for coalescing
   - No explicit memory access pattern optimization
   - Missing GPU-specific memory traits

3. **Missed Team Parallelism Opportunities**
   - Sequential k-loops could be parallelized within teams
   - No use of team scratch memory for temporaries
   - Global memory traffic for intermediate arrays

4. **Specific Recommendations**:
   - Implement TeamPolicy single-kernel approach
   - Use LayoutLeft for coalesced access patterns  
   - Add RandomAccess traits for read-only data
   - Move temporaries to team scratch memory

### **Demo Talking Point**:
*"Notice Amp doesn't just say 'make it faster' - it identifies specific architectural issues and provides concrete optimization strategies."*

---

## üß† **Amp Prompt #2: Oracle Consultation**

### **Prompt to Amp**:
```
Based on your analysis, I want expert-level guidance on optimizing this tridiagonal solver. Please consult the Oracle to get detailed optimization recommendations with expected performance impact.

Focus on creating a production-ready GPU-optimized implementation that maintains perfect numerical accuracy.
```

### **Expected Amp Response**:
Amp will use the Oracle tool and receive guidance on:

1. **TeamPolicy Single-Kernel Architecture**
   ```cpp
   // Replace O(nk) launches with single kernel
   TeamPolicy<ExecSpace> policy(ni, Kokkos::AUTO);
   ```

2. **Memory Layout Optimization** 
   ```cpp
   using Layout = LayoutLeft;  // Explicit coalescing
   View<double**, Layout, MemSpace> arrays;
   ```

3. **GPU Memory Traits**
   ```cpp
   using ReadOnlyTraits = MemoryTraits<RandomAccess>;
   View<const double**, Layout, MemSpace, ReadOnlyTraits> coefficients;
   ```

4. **Performance Expectation**: 5-10x improvement expected from eliminating launch overhead alone

### **Demo Talking Point**:
*"The Oracle provides expert-level optimization guidance - this is like having a Kokkos performance specialist on demand."*

---

## ‚ö° **Amp Prompt #3: Implementation**

### **Prompt to Amp**:
```
Excellent analysis! Now implement the Oracle's recommendations. 

Create an optimized version with:
1. Single TeamPolicy kernel eliminating O(nk) launches
2. LayoutLeft memory layout for GPU coalescing  
3. RandomAccess traits for read-only coefficient arrays
4. Team scratch memory for c_prime and y_prime temporaries
5. Performance comparison capability (naive vs optimized)

Put the optimized implementation in kokkos/mitgcm_demo_optimized/ and ensure it can demonstrate the speedup achieved.
```

### **Expected Amp Actions**:
1. **Create Directory Structure**
   ```
   kokkos/mitgcm_demo_optimized/src/kernel.cpp
   ```

2. **Implement TeamPolicy Approach**
   - Single kernel with team-based parallelization
   - Sequential k-loops within each team
   - Proper team scratch memory allocation

3. **Add Performance Comparison**
   - Both naive and optimized implementations in same binary
   - Timing comparison with warmup iterations
   - Speedup calculation and reporting

4. **Memory Optimization**  
   - Explicit LayoutLeft specification
   - RandomAccess traits for read-only data
   - Team scratch for temporaries

### **Demo Talking Point**:
*"Watch Amp implement complex Kokkos optimizations automatically. This level of optimization typically requires deep expertise and significant development time."*

---

## üß™ **Amp Prompt #4: Performance Validation**

### **Prompt to Amp**:
```
Now I need to validate that the optimization works and maintains numerical accuracy. 

Create a comprehensive test that:
1. Builds both naive and optimized versions
2. Runs performance comparison  
3. Validates numerical accuracy is maintained
4. Shows the achieved speedup

Make it automated so I can demonstrate the results reliably.
```

### **Expected Amp Actions**:
1. **Create Test Script** (`test_demo.sh`)
   - Automated build verification
   - Performance benchmark execution
   - Numerical accuracy validation
   - Results summary

2. **Performance Verification**
   ```bash
   kokkos/mitgcm_demo_optimized/build/kernel 1024 10 both
   ```
   Expected: ~20-30x speedup

3. **Numerical Accuracy Check**
   - Compare Fortran reference vs optimized Kokkos
   - Verify `max_abs_diff = 0.0` maintained
   - Automated pass/fail validation

### **Expected Results Display**:
```
‚úÖ Build successful  
‚úÖ 33.17x speedup achieved
‚úÖ Perfect numerical agreement verified
